						<p style="float:left">This site was created by Spencer Lee and John Nulf. Spencer and John are students at Charlotte High School and members of the student organization Business Professionals of America (BPA). For the 2016-2017 school year, they entered a "Website Deisgn Team" competition. The criteria was to create a DIY (Do it yourself) website, and wanting to escape the dainty crafts and recipies of stereotypical DIY websites, they opted for something a little more hardcore. Thus, Survive It Yourself was born!<p>
						<p class="about-us-text">Hi!  My name is Spencer Lee. I am a junior in highschool, and this is my second year in BPA. I plan on pursuing Computer Science for my major so that I may develop a career in software developing. I am an avid video gamer, and I enjoy playing my ocarina when I can. I handled most of the hard coding for this website.</p>
						<p class="about-us-text">Hey, I'm John Nulf, and I'm a Senior in high school. I enjoy playing tennis for fun and on our school varsity team. I am also the treasurer for my BPA chapter. This is my third year in BPA, and I have had the privilege of attending the State Leadership Conference the last two years and attending the National Leadership Conference last year, in Boston. I am excited for the opportunity to compete again this year and gain more leadership skills. I handled most of the design and graphics of this website. In my free time I love to play piano. I created the video on the home page of the website, including the background track.</p>
